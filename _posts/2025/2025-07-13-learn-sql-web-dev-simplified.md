# Learn SQL - Web Dev Simplified

**SQL** (*Structured Query Language*) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. Below is a quick summary based on the [Web Dev Simplified SQL tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3qvj9hO_Bo), with short explanations before each code section.

Before diving into the world of **SQL**, you‚Äôll need a **SQL environment**. There are many tools available for this. If you prefer a graphical user interface, you might want to try [**MySQL Workbench**](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).  

In my case, I used **MySQL** and **phpMyAdmin** installed via `docker`. I‚Äôve written a post explaining how to set it up, check it out here: [Install MySQL and phpMyAdmin using Docker in Ubuntu](/posts/install-mysql-and-phpmyadmin-using-docker-in-ubuntu/).


## SQL Basics

This section introduces foundational **SQL** operations to help you create and interact with relational databases. You‚Äôll learn how to create databases and tables, insert and query data, apply filters, join tables, and perform aggregations.


### üìò Create & Select a Database

These commands are essential for setting up and switching between databases.

```sql
-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE testdb;

-- Delete a database (‚ö†Ô∏è This operation is irreversible)
DROP DATABASE testdb;

-- Select the active database to use
USE testdb;
```


### üß± Creating Tables

Once your database is created, you can define tables to store structured data. Below is an example for a music catalog containing bands and their albums.

```sql
-- Create a new database for storing record data
CREATE DATABASE record_company;

-- Create a table to store band information
CREATE TABLE bands (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Add a new column to the bands table (e.g., for country or genre)
ALTER TABLE bands 
ADD added_col VARCHAR(255);
```

```sql
-- Create an albums table with a foreign key linking to bands
CREATE TABLE albums (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    release_year INT,
    band_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (band_id) REFERENCES bands(id)
);
```


### ‚úçÔ∏è Insert & Query Data

Once tables are defined, use `INSERT` to add data and `SELECT` to retrieve it.

```sql
-- Insert a single band into the bands table
INSERT INTO bands (name)
VALUES ('Iron Maiden');

-- Insert multiple bands in a single command
INSERT INTO bands (name)
VALUES ('Deuce'), ('Avenged Sevenfold'), ('Ankor');
```

```sql
-- View all records from the bands table
SELECT * FROM bands;

-- Retrieve only the first two bands
SELECT * FROM bands LIMIT 2;

-- Use aliasing for clearer column names in results
SELECT id AS 'ID', name AS 'Band Name'
FROM bands;

-- Sort bands in descending alphabetical order
SELECT * FROM bands ORDER BY name DESC;
```

```sql
-- Insert multiple albums referencing band IDs
INSERT INTO albums (name, release_year, band_id)
VALUES 
  ('The Number of the Beasts', 1985, 1),
  ('Power Slave', 1984, 1),
  ('Nightmare', 2018, 2),
  ('Nightmare', 2010, 3),
  ('Test Album', NULL, 3);
```


### üîé Filtering Data

Use the `WHERE` clause to filter results based on conditions.

```sql
-- Retrieve unique album names (no duplicates)
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM albums;

-- Update a specific album's release year
UPDATE albums
SET release_year = 1982
WHERE id = 1;
```

```sql
-- Find albums released before the year 2000
SELECT * FROM albums
WHERE release_year < 2000;

-- Filter by partial name or specific band ID
SELECT * FROM albums
WHERE name LIKE '%er%' OR band_id = 2;
```

```sql
-- Find albums released between two years
SELECT * FROM albums
WHERE release_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2019;

-- Show albums with unknown release years
SELECT * FROM albums
WHERE release_year IS NULL;

-- Remove entries with missing release years
DELETE FROM albums
WHERE release_year IS NULL;
```


### üîó Joining Tables

`JOIN` operations allow you to query related data across multiple tables.

```sql
-- Match albums with their corresponding bands
SELECT * FROM bands
JOIN albums ON bands.id = albums.band_id;
```

**Join Types Overview:**

* `INNER JOIN`: Returns only rows with matching values in both tables.
* `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table, with matching rows from the right (if any).
* `RIGHT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the right table, with matching rows from the left (if any).


### üìä Aggregation & Grouping

Aggregate functions let you summarize and group your data.

```sql
-- Average release year of all albums
SELECT AVG(release_year) FROM albums;

-- Count how many albums each band has (by band ID)
SELECT band_id, COUNT(*) AS album_count
FROM albums
GROUP BY band_id;
```

```sql
-- Count albums per band, showing band names instead of IDs
SELECT 
  b.name AS band_name, 
  COUNT(a.id) AS num_albums
FROM bands AS b
LEFT JOIN albums AS a ON a.band_id = b.id
GROUP BY b.id
HAVING num_albums >= 1;
```

> ‚úÖ **Tip:** Use `HAVING` instead of `WHERE` when filtering grouped data.


This guide gives you a solid foundation for working with relational databases. As you get comfortable with these commands, you'll be ready to build more complex queries and applications using SQL.


## Exercises

After exploring some basic **SQL** concepts, this section focuses on a series of exercises primarily proposed by **WebDevSimplified**. These exercises are designed to be solved after watching the related video or by following along with the previous steps. They are available in his GitHub repository [**Learn-SQL**](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Learn-SQL/tree/master). In the `README.md` file, each question is followed by the expected output, you'll need to figure out the appropriate SQL query to produce that output.

In this post, we share our proposed solutions. First, let's explore the database schema and set up the environment.

The database contains three tables: <kbd>bands</kbd>, <kbd>albums</kbd>, and <kbd>songs</kbd>. The schema is illustrated in the figure below:

![Database Schema](assets/posts/sql-db-schema.png)

### Environment Setup

Make sure you have an environment where you can run **SQL queries**. As explained earlier, start by creating a database named `record_company`, then create the schema shown in the figure above.

Once the database is created, insert the required data by running the SQL script provided [here](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Learn-SQL/blob/master/data.sql).

After completing the setup, you can begin solving the exercises.


1. Create a `songs` Table

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    length INT NOT NULL,
    album_id INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (album_id) REFERENCES albums(id)
    );
    ```


2. Select only the Names of all the Bands
    
    ```sql
    SELECT name as "Band Name" FROM bands;
    ```

    | Band Name         | 
    |-------------------| 
    | Seventh Wonder    | 
    | Metallica         | 
    | The Ocean         |

    | Van Canto         | 
    | Dream Theater     | 

3. Select the Oldest Album

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM albums
    WHERE release_year IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY release_year ASC LIMIT 1;
    ```

    | id | name                   | release_year | band_id | 
    |----|------------------------|--------------|---------| 
    | 5  | ...And Justice for All | 1988         | 2       | 

4. Get all Bands that have Albums

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT b.name as 'Band Name' FROM bands as b 
    JOIN albums as a ON a.band_id = b.id;
    ```

    | Band Name         | 
    |-------------------| 
    | Seventh Wonder    | 
    | Metallica         |

    | Within Temptation | 
    | Death             | 
    | Van Canto         | 

5. Get all Bands that have No Albums

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT b.name as 'Band Name' FROM bands as b 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN albums as a ON a.band_id = b.id
    WHERE a.id IS NULL;
    ```

    | Band Name     | 
    |---------------| 
    | Dream Theater | 

6. Get the Longest Album

    ```sql
    SELECT 
      a.name, 
      a.release_year, 	
      SUM(s.length) AS length 
    FROM albums AS a 
    JOIN songs AS s ON a.id = s.album_id
    GROUP BY a.name, a.release_year
    ORDER BY length DESC LIMIT 1;
    ```

    | Name           | Release Year | Duration          | 
    |----------------|--------------|-------------------| 
    | Death Magnetic | 2008         | 74.76666593551636 | 

7. Update the Release Year of the Album with no Release Year

    ```sql
    UPDATE albums
    SET release_year = 1986
    WHERE release_year IS NULL;
    ```

8. Insert a record for your favorite Band and one of their Albums

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO bands (name)
    VALUES ('Favorite Band Name');

    INSERT INTO albums (name, release_year, band_id)
    VALUES ('Favorite Album Name', 2000, 8);
    ```

9. Delete the Band and Album you added in #8

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM albums
    WHERE id = 8;

    DELETE FROM bands
    WHERE id = 8;
    ```

10. Get the Average Length of all Songs

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(length) as "Average Song Duration" FROM songs; 
    ```

    | Average Song Duration | 
    |-----------------------| 
    | 5.352472513259112     | 

11. Select the longest Song off each Album

    ```sql
    SELECT 
      a.name AS "Album",
        a.release_year AS "Release Year",
        MAX(s.length) AS "Duration"
    FROM albums AS a 
    JOIN songs AS s ON a.id = s.album_id
    GROUP BY a.name, a.release_year;
    ```

      b.name AS "Band",
      COUNT(s.name) AS "Number of Songs"
    FROM bands as b
    JOIN albums as a ON b.id = a.band_id
    JOIN songs as s ON a.id = s.album_id
    GROUP BY b.name;
    ```

    | Band              | Number of Songs | 
    |-------------------|-----------------|
